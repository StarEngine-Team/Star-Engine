<h2 align="center">An open-source engine made for fun</h2>

**THIS ENGINE USES THE FOREVER ENGINE LEGACY AS ITS BASE!!**

----------------------------------------------
# Features
* Nothing, for now

# Features (Forever Engine):
* Noteskins;
* Custom UIs;
* Options Menu with FPS Capping and Adjustments;
* A lot of modularity and freedom with options
    * (Hopefully in the future *everything* will be toggleable);
* A restructure/partial remake of the base game's codebase;
* ``source/`` folder abstraction;
* More streamlined code
    * (only having to set things in one place).

    * maintainer of the engine as of recent events.
    * she likes how the note splash looks;
* Yoshubs:
    * made the engine,
    * happens to be very fucking stupid for accidentally pushing the martian mixtape source code into legacy's base github page
    * Nobody, and I repeat, NOBODY, support Shubs' doings on the internet
